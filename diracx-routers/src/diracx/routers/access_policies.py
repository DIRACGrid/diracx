"""AccessPolicy.

We define a set of Policy classes (WMS, DFC, etc).
They have a default implementation in diracx.
If an extension wants to change it, it can be overwritten in the entry point
diracx.access_policies

Each route should either:
* have the open_access decorator to make explicit that it does not implement policy
* have a callable and call it that will perform the access policy


Adding a new policy:
1. Create a class that inherits from BaseAccessPolicy and implement the ``policy`` and ``enrich_tokens`` methods
2. create an entry in diracx.access_policy entrypoints
3. Create a dependency such as CheckMyPolicyCallable = Annotated[Callable, Depends(MyAccessPolicy.check)]
