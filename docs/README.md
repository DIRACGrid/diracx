## Run a full diracx demo

This will allow you to run a demo setup.

The code changes will be reflected in the demo.

Requirement: docker, internet

```bash
# Clone the diracx repository
git clone git@github.com:DIRACGrid/diracx.git

# Clone the diracx-chart repository
git clone git@github.com:DIRACGrid/diracx-charts.git

# Run the demo
diracx-charts/run_demo.sh diracx/
```

To login, click the **authorize** button

![authorize](login_demo_1.png)

Connect using the authorization code flow, ticking the "vo:diracAdmin" scope

And enter the credentials prompted by the `run_demo.sh` script in the `Dex` interface

## Create the dev environment

This will help you setup a dev environment to run the unit tests

Requirements: conda, git

```bash
# Clone the diracx repository
git clone git@github.com:DIRACGrid/diracx.git
cd diracx

# Create the mamba environment
mamba env create --file environment.yml
conda activate diracx-dev

# Make an editable installation of diracx

pip install -e .

# Install the integration branch of DIRAC
pip install git+https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC.git@integration

# Enable pre-commit
mamba install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### Run the test

Run the unit tests

```bash
# In the `diracx` folder
pytest
mypy .
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Run a local instance of diracx

This only runs the diracx server, not any dependency like external IdP.


```bash
# In the `diracx` folder
./run_local.sh
```


## Add a DB

Database classes live in `src/diracx/db/<dbname>`. Have a look at the `src/diracx/db/dummy/` to see how to implement your own DB

* We do not want to use the `ORM` part of `SQLAlchemy` (only the `core`) for performance reasons


## Dependency injection

Dependencies to routes on services are injected as function parameters.
See the FastAPI documentation for details.

In DiracX we have a few additional dependencies which can be injected like so:

```python
@router.get("/dummy")
def my_route(
    config: Annotated[Config, Depends(ConfigSource.create)],
    settings: Annotated[AuthSettings, Depends(AuthSettings.create)],
    job_db: Annotated[JobDB, Depends(JobDB.transaction)],
    user_info: Annotated[UserInfo, Depends(verify_dirac_token)],
) -> MyReturnType:
    ...
```

### Configuration

The `config` object is an instance of the config model schema for the current service (e.g. `diracx.core.config.Config`).
This object is immutable and remains constant for the duration of the function call.
Caching is handled externally to services.

### Settings

Unlike in DIRAC, DiracX separates some information from the "Configuration" (e.g. secrets).
To access this information you depend on the `SettingsClass.create` method which returns a cached instance of the given class.

### Databases

The `job_db` object is an instance of the given db (e.g. `JobDB`).
A single transaction is used for the duration of the request and it is automatically committed when the function returns.
If an exception is raised the transaction is rolled back.
Connections are pooled between requests.

### User information

The `user_info` object contains validation information about the current user, extracted from the authorization header of the request.
See the `UserInfo` class for the available properties.

## Adding a router

To add a router there are two steps:

1. Create a module in `diracx.routers` for the given service.
2. Add an entry to the `diracx.services` entrypoint.

We'll now make a `/parking/` router which contains information store in the `DummyDB`.

### Creating the router submodule

TODO: This isn't yet documented here however see `diracx.routers.well_known` for an example.

### Defining the new router in the `diracx.services` entrypoint

Modify the package's `setup.cfg`

```ini
[options.entry_points]
diracx.services =
	parking = diracx.routers.parking:router
```


This will prefix the routes with `/parking/` and mark them with the `"parking"` tag in the OpenAPI spec.

> [!WARNING]
> Any modification in the `setup.cfg` requires to re-install install `diracx`, even if it is a developer installation (`pip install -e`)


## Conventions

### Coding style

Most style are enforced with the pre-commit hooks which automatically reformat the code and sort the imports.
Code should follow PEP-8, particularly for [naming conventions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#prescriptive-naming-conventions) as these aren't modified by the pre-commit hooks.

#### Import style

In addition to the automatic sorting

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

import pytest
```
